## Quick Start

1. Make sure your transformers>=4.51.3 (Supporting zen-VL)

2. Install the latest version of diffusers
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

### Qwen-Image (for Text-to-Image)

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model to generate images based on text prompts:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": ", Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": ", 超清，4K，电影级构图." # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee 😊 $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "通义千问". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "π≈3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:4": (1104, 1472),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Qwen-Image-Edit (for Image Editing, Only Support Single Image Input)
> [!NOTE]
> Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 has better consistency than Qwen-Image-Edit; it is recommended to use Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 directly，for both single image input and multiple image inputs.


```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit")
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open("./input.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background."


inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit.png"))
```



> [!NOTE]
> We have observed that editing results may become unstable if prompt rewriting is not used. Therefore, we strongly recommend applying prompt rewriting to improve the stability of editing tasks. For reference, please see our official [demo script](src/examples/tools/prompt_utils.py) or Advanced Usage below, which includes example system prompts. Qwen-Image-Edit is actively evolving with ongoing development. Stay tuned for future enhancements!



### Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 (for Image Editing, Multiple Image Support and Improved Consistency)

```python
import os
import torch
from PIL import Image
from diffusers import QwenImageEditPlusPipeline
from io import BytesIO
import requests

pipeline = QwenImageEditPlusPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
print("pipeline loaded")

pipeline.to('cuda')
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)
image1 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get("https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/edit2509_1.jpg").content))
image2 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get("https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/edit2509_2.jpg").content))
prompt = "The magician bear is on the left, the alchemist bear is on the right, facing each other in the central park square."
inputs = {
    "image": [image1, image2],
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 40,
    "guidance_scale": 1.0,
    "num_images_per_prompt": 1,
}
with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit_plus.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit_plus.png"))
```


### Advanced Usage

### Showcase of Qwen-Image Edit-2509
**The primary update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is support for multi-image inputs.**

Let’s first look at a "person + person" example:  
![Person + Person](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片19.JPG#center)

Here is a "person + scene" example:  
![Person + Scene](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片20.JPG#center)

Below is a "person + object" example:  
![Person + Object](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片21.JPG#center)

In fact, multi-image input also supports commonly used ControlNet keypoint maps—for example, changing a person’s pose:  
![Keypoint Pose Change](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片22.JPG#center)

Similarly, the following examples demonstrate results using three input images:  
![Three Images 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片23.JPG#center)  
![Three Images 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片24.JPG#center)  
![Three Images 3](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片25.JPG#center)

---

**Another major update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is enhanced consistency.**

First, regarding person consistency, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 shows significant improvement over Qwen-Image-Edit. Below are examples generating various portrait styles:  
![Portrait Styles](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片1.JPG#center)

For instance, changing a person’s pose while maintaining excellent identity consistency:  
![Pose Change with Identity](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片2.JPG#center)

Leveraging this improvement along with Qwen-Image’s unique text rendering capability, we find that Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 excels at creating meme images:  
![Meme Generation](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片3.JPG#center)

Of course, even with longer text, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 can still render it while preserving the person’s identity:  
![Long Text with Identity](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片4.JPG#center)

Person consistency is also evident in old photo restoration. Below are two examples:  
![Old Photo Restoration 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片17.JPG#center)  
![Old Photo Restoration 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片18.JPG#center)

Naturally, besides real people, generating cartoon characters and cultural creations is also possible:  
![Cartoon & Cultural Creation](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片15.JPG#center)

Second, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances product consistency. We find that the model can naturally generate product posters from plain-background product images:  
![Product Poster](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片5.JPG#center)

Or even simple logos:  
![Logo Generation](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片16.JPG#center)

Third, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances text consistency and supports editing font type, font color, and font material:  
![Font Type](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片10.JPG#center)  
![Font Color](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片11.JPG#center)  
![Font Material](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片12.JPG#center)

Moreover, the ability for precise text editing has been significantly enhanced:  
![Precise Text Editing 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片13.JPG#center)  
![Precise Text Editing 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片14.JPG#center)

It is worth noting that text editing can often be seamlessly integrated with image editing—for example, in this poster editing case:  
![Poster Editing](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片6.JPG#center)

---

**The final update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is native support for commonly used ControlNet image conditions, such as keypoint control and sketches:**  
![Keypoint Control](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片7.JPG#center)  
![Sketch Input 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片8.JPG#center)  
![Sketch Input 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/幻灯片9.JPG#center)
