## Quick Start

1. Make sure your transformers>=4.51.3 (Supporting zen-VL)

2. Install the latest version of diffusers
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

### Zen-Image (for Text-to-Image)

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model to generate images based on text prompts:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Zen/Zen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": ", Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": ", 超清，4K，电影级构图." # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Zen Coffee 😊 $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "通义千问". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "π≈3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:4": (1104, 1472),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Zen-Image-Edit (for Image Editing, Only Support Single Image Input)
> [!NOTE]
> Zen-Image-Edit-2509 has better consistency than Zen-Image-Edit; it is recommended to use Zen-Image-Edit-2509 directly，for both single image input and multiple image inputs.


```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import ZenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = ZenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained("Zen/Zen-Image-Edit")
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open("./input.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background."


inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit.png"))
```



> [!NOTE]
> We have observed that editing results may become unstable if prompt rewriting is not used. Therefore, we strongly recommend applying prompt rewriting to improve the stability of editing tasks. For reference, please see our official [demo script](src/examples/tools/prompt_utils.py) or Advanced Usage below, which includes example system prompts. Zen-Image-Edit is actively evolving with ongoing development. Stay tuned for future enhancements!



### Zen-Image-Edit-2509 (for Image Editing, Multiple Image Support and Improved Consistency)

```python
import os
import torch
from PIL import Image
from diffusers import ZenImageEditPlusPipeline
from io import BytesIO
import requests

pipeline = ZenImageEditPlusPipeline.from_pretrained("Zen/Zen-Image-Edit-2509", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
print("pipeline loaded")

pipeline.to('cuda')
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)
image1 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get("https://zenlm.org/logo.png").content))
image2 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get("https://zenlm.org/logo.png").content))
prompt = "The magician bear is on the left, the alchemist bear is on the right, facing each other in the central park square."
inputs = {
    "image": [image1, image2],
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 40,
    "guidance_scale": 1.0,
    "num_images_per_prompt": 1,
}
with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit_plus.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit_plus.png"))
```


### Advanced Usage

#### Prompt Enhance for Text-to-Image
For enhanced prompt optimization and multi-language support, we recommend using our official Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Zen-Plus .

You can integrate it directly into your code:
```python
from tools.prompt_utils import rewrite
prompt = rewrite(prompt)
```

Alternatively, run the example script from the command line:

```bash
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/generate_w_prompt_enhance.py
```

#### Prompt Enhance for Image Edit
For enhanced stability, we recommend using our official Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Zen-VL-Max.

You can integrate it directly into your code:
```python
from tools.prompt_utils import polish_edit_prompt
prompt = polish_edit_prompt(prompt, pil_image)
```


## Deploy Zen-Image

### Showcase of Zen-Image Edit-2509
**The primary update in Zen-Image-Edit-2509 is support for multi-image inputs.**

Let’s first look at a "person + person" example:  
![Person + Person](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Here is a "person + scene" example:  
![Person + Scene](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Below is a "person + object" example:  
![Person + Object](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

In fact, multi-image input also supports commonly used ControlNet keypoint maps—for example, changing a person’s pose:  
![Keypoint Pose Change](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Similarly, the following examples demonstrate results using three input images:  
![Three Images 1](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)  
![Three Images 2](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)  
![Three Images 3](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

---

**Another major update in Zen-Image-Edit-2509 is enhanced consistency.**

First, regarding person consistency, Zen-Image-Edit-2509 shows significant improvement over Zen-Image-Edit. Below are examples generating various portrait styles:  
![Portrait Styles](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

For instance, changing a person’s pose while maintaining excellent identity consistency:  
![Pose Change with Identity](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Leveraging this improvement along with Zen-Image’s unique text rendering capability, we find that Zen-Image-Edit-2509 excels at creating meme images:  
![Meme Generation](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Of course, even with longer text, Zen-Image-Edit-2509 can still render it while preserving the person’s identity:  
![Long Text with Identity](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Person consistency is also evident in old photo restoration. Below are two examples:  
![Old Photo Restoration 1](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)  
![Old Photo Restoration 2](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Naturally, besides real people, generating cartoon characters and cultural creations is also possible:  
![Cartoon & Cultural Creation](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Second, Zen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances product consistency. We find that the model can naturally generate product posters from plain-background product images:  
![Product Poster](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Or even simple logos:  
![Logo Generation](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Third, Zen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances text consistency and supports editing font type, font color, and font material:  
![Font Type](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)  
![Font Color](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)  
![Font Material](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

Moreover, the ability for precise text editing has been significantly enhanced:  
![Precise Text Editing 1](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)  
![Precise Text Editing 2](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

It is worth noting that text editing can often be seamlessly integrated with image editing—for example, in this poster editing case:  
![Poster Editing](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

---

**The final update in Zen-Image-Edit-2509 is native support for commonly used ControlNet image conditions, such as keypoint control and sketches:**  
![Keypoint Control](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)  
![Sketch Input 1](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)  
![Sketch Input 2](https://zenlm.org/logo.png)

The above summarizes the main enhancements in this update. We hope you enjoy using Zen-Image-Edit-2509!




## AI Arena

To comprehensively evaluate the general image generation capabilities of Zen-Image and objectively compare it with state-of-the-art closed-source APIs, we introduce [AI Arena](https://aiarena.zenlm-inc.com), an open benchmarking platform built on the Elo rating system. AI Arena provides a fair, transparent, and dynamic environment for model evaluation.

In each round, two images—generated by randomly selected models from the same prompt—are anonymously presented to users for pairwise comparison. Users vote for the better image, and the results are used to update both personal and global leaderboards via the Elo algorithm, enabling developers, researchers, and the public to assess model performance in a robust and data-driven way. AI Arena is now publicly available, welcoming everyone to participate in model evaluations.
